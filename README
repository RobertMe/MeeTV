Introduction
============
MeeTV is an application for MeeGo, the Nokia N9 especially, to control some of
the functionalities of TVHeadend, a TV streaming server for Linux. The
currently supported features are the following:
* Browsing tags
* Browsing channels within their tag group
* View events (TV shows) within their channel
* Viewing event details
* Adding an event to be recorded
* Searching the EPG, filtering on tag and channel possible

Getting the code
================
The code is hosted on Github and may be downloaded from there. To get the code
you first need to install git package provided by your distribution. Afterwards
you need to run the following commands:

  $ git clone git://github.com/RobertMe/MeeTV.git
  $ cd MeeTV
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule add

Installing the prerequisites
============================
To compile the code you need a build environment for MeeGo. The easiest way to
install this is using the Qt SDK, which can be downloaded from
http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk. During the installation make sure to
install the Harmattan Target and Qt Quick Components (Development Tools ->
Harmattan). Another prerequisite is enabling developer mode on the device,
This can be done by toggling Settings -> Security -> Developer Mode to on.

Setting up Qt Creator
=====================
The application will be build and deployed using Qt Creator. Qt Creator is also
included in the Qt SDK and installed by default. First you'll need to add your
MeeGo device to the list of devices. This may be done by starting Qt Creator,
and navigating through Tools -> Options -> Linux Devices. Click Add, select
'Device with MADDE support' and Start Wizard. Fill in the required information,
which may be found by opening the SDK Connectivity app on the device. Finish
the wizard and Apply the changed settings.

Compiling the application
=========================
Open the MeeTV.pro file in the root of the project with QtCreator. When prompted
to select the targets untick Desktop and tick at least Harmattan, you may also
tick Qt Simulator if you want to run the app in the simulator. Afterwards make
sure the run configuration has the remove device set as current device by
navigation to Projects in the left toolbar, and selecting Run on the Harmattan
tab. Then make sure the Device configuration is set to MeeGo Device (or the name
you entered in the device add wizard). Then make sure the Harmattan target is
still the current configuration by checking the bottom of the main toolbar. When
you click on the phone button the Harmattan target should be blue (active). Next
in the main menu select Build -> Build All, after the build process completes,
select Build -> Deploy All. This installs the application to your device.

Running the application
=======================
After you've installed the app on your device you should be able to run it.
There should be a MeeTV application on the application homescreen which starts
the application. On the first run it will automaticly open the settings screen
where you'll need to provide the hostname, portnumber and possibly username and
password to connect to your TVHeadend server. You could just close the settings
screen and the app will automaticly try to (re)connect.

Changing settings after first run
=================================
To change one of the settings you can use the devices Settings application. The
MeeTV app can be found in the Application menu. If you change the username or
password they will automaticly be resend when the app gets active. If you change
the hostname or portnumber these will be used on the next connect attempt. This
most probably means you'll need to restart the app if it was already running.
